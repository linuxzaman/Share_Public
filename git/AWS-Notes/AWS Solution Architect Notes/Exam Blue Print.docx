AWS Service Overview
======================

AWS Global Infrastructure

A Region is a geographical area. Each Region consist of 2 or more Availability Zones(Data Centers)


Edge Locations(caching content)
    This are endpoints for AWS which are used for caching content. typically this consists of CloudFront, Amazon's content Delivery Network(CDN)
    There are many more Edge locations than regions currently there are over 150 Edge locations

Bread and Butter of Service:
    1.  Security, identity and compliance
            IAM
    2.  Compute
            EC2
            LAMBDA
    3.  Storage
            S3
    4.  Network and content Delivery
            ROUTE53
            VPC
            CloudFront
    5.  Databases
            RDS
            DynamoDB

IAM
    IAM allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS Console.
    Features:
        Centralised control of your AWS account
        Shared Access to your AWS account
        Granular Permissions
        identity Federation(Facebook,etc)
        Multifactor Authentication
        provide temporary access for users and servcies where necessary
        Allows you to set up your own password rotation policy
        Integrates with many different AWS servcies
        Supports PCI DSS compliance

    Key Terminology for IAM
        1.  users
                End users such as people, employees of an organizations etc.
        2.  Groups
                A collection of users, Each user in the group will inherit the permissions of the group
        3.  Policies
                Policies are made up of documents, called policy documents. These documents are in a format called JSON and they give permissions as to what a user/group/role is able to do.
        4.  Roles
                You create roles and then assign them to AWS Resources

IAM accoutns are global basis.

Exam Tips for IAM
    1.  IAM is universal. it does not apply to regions at this time.
    2.  The "root account" is simply the account created when first setup your aws account. it has complete Admin access.
    3.  New Users have NO permissions when first created.
    4.  New users are assigned ACcess key ID and Secret Access keys when first created.
    5.  These are not the same as a password. you cannot use the Access key id and secret access key to login in to the console. you can use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line, however.
    6.  You only get to view these once. if you lose them, you have to regenerate them. so, save them in a secure locations.
    7.  Always setup MFA on your root account.
    8.  you can create and customise your own password rotation Policies.

        S3  
=======================

S3 Simple Storage Service
    S3 Provides developers and IT Teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve an y amount of data from anywhere on the web.
    s3 is a safe place to store your files.
    it is object-based storage.
    The Data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.

S3-Basics
    *.  S3 is object-based -- ie allows you to upload.
    *.  Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB.
    *.  There is unlimited Storage.
    *.   Files are Stored in Buckets.
    *.  S3 is a universal namespace.
    *.  when you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTTP 200 Code if the upload was successful.
S3-Objects
    S3 is Objects based. Think of Objects just as files.
    Objects consist of the following:
        Key
        Value
        Version ID
        Metadata
        Subresources
            Access control lists
            Torrents

Data Consistency Model for s3
    How does data consistency work for S3?
        Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
        Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES

S3-Guarantees
    Built for 99.99% Availability for the S3 Platform
    Amazon Guarantees 99.99% Availability
    Amazon Guarantees 99.99999999999% durability for S3 information(Remember 11 x 9s

S3-Features
    Tiered Storage Available
    Lifecycle Management
    Versioning
    Encryption
    MFA Deletes
    Secure your data using Access Control List and Buckets Policies

S3 Storage Classes
    S3-Standard
        99.99% Availability,durability,stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently
    S3-IA(Infrequently Accessed)
        For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3, but you are charged a retrieve fee.
    S3 One Zone-IA 
        For Where you want a Lower-cost option for Infrequently accessed data, but do not requires the multiple Availability Zone data resilience.
    S3- Intelligent Tiering
        designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier,without performance impact or operational overhead
    S3-Glacier
        S3 Glacier is a secure,durable,and low-cost storage class for data archiving. you can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours
    S3-Glacier Deep Archive
        S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3's lowest-cost storage class where a retrieve tiem of 12 hours is acceptable.

S3-Charges based on
    Storage
    Requests
    Storage Management Pricing
    Data Transfer Pricing
    Transfer Acceleration(CloudFront)
    Cross Region Replication Pricing(high Availability)


Exam Tips
    Remember that s3 is object based
    files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB
    There is unlimited storage
    files are stored in Buckets
    s3 is a universal namespace
    https://s3-eu-west-1.Amazonaws.com/acloudguru
    not suitable to install an operating system on.
    successful uploads will generate a HTTP 200 Status Code
    you can turn on MFS Deletes
    key
    Value
    version id
    Metadata
    Subresources
        access control lists
        Torrents
    Read after wirte consistency for PUTS of new object
    Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES

notes: Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive 5 GB of Amazon S3 Standard storage, 20,000 Get Requests, 2,000 Put Requests, 15GB of data transfer in, and 15GB of data transfer out each month for one year.
